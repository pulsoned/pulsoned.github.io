YESS (Y86 Simulator)
========
 
YESS is a (currently incomplete) working simulator of the Y86 assembly architecture.  It allows you to input a text file containing working Y86 code and will simulate that code as if run by the Y86 architecture.
 
Features
--------
 
- Simulates a working Y86 architecture
- Allows user-inputted Y86 code to be run
- Is very cool
 
Installation
------------
 
Install YESS by downloading [here](https://www.google.com) (fake link) and run via unix bash.
 
    
Support

If you are having issues, you can contact me at pulsoned@appstate.edu.

FAQs
-------
***What is this program used for?***

Mostly, this program is an exercise in my basic understanding of C++ and Computer Systems, however it can (or will be able to) be used to successfully run working Y86 code.

***When will the YESS be complete?***

The YESS should be complete by the end of April at the latest.

Contribute
----------
 
Contribution is currently not supported due to the YESS being in an unfinished state. Since the program is a project for an ongoing course, the code cannot be open-source without violating Appalachian State's 
 Academic Integrity Code.
 
License
-------
 
I don't understand how licensing works but I assume this project is unlicensed.

How to use
-------
 
Navigate to the folder that contains `yess` and then simply type

    ./yess <filepath>/<yofilename>.yo

where `<filepath>` is the path to the file you'd like to run and `<yofilename>` is the name of the file, press enter, and your file will run!
